# Church App

This was a fun project - what definitely took me the longest was to get past a lot of CORS errors I faced. I tried many solutions only to realize that because of my lack of Groovy knowledge, I had an issue with my `application.yml` file's indentation haha

Overall was a lot of fun - a challenging part was working with Groovy and writing integration tests for it.

This code can be run by opening the `church` directory and using the command `grails run-app`, then opening the `church-app` directory and running the command `npm serve`. The project will be available on the 4200 port.
